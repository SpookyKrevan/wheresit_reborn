# Wherezit Classic
This project started a few years ago when I wanted to have an easy way to figure out where herb nodes were when looking at recipes in the alchemy profession tab. Slowly I added more and more herbs to the addon, and then I abandoned the project due to family issues and not having enough time to work on it.

With WoW Classic coming out soon, I am planning on working on the addon to make it work with WoW Classic, and then maybe work on finally updating it with everything that is needed for the main game as well.
